# Proxy Design Pattern

Design Patterns are a series of project design conventions learned and refined over the years by various programmers and across different technologies. It is important to understand what each pattern aims to solve before implementing it. They are not a silver bullet; knowing their advantages and disadvantages is crucial.

## What is the Proxy Pattern?

The Proxy acts as a "gatekeeper" or intermediary between the client and the real object. It controls access, potentially protecting, optimizing, or adding extra functionality without modifying the original object.

### Example Use Case

Imagine you have a report generation class with high complexity, and you want to cache this information for 5 minutes. Instead of implementing this logic in the Controller (which would violate several software design principles), you could use the Proxy pattern to act as an intermediary between the caching logic and the business rules.

In this example, the `ReportGeneratorProxy` uses a cache to store reports for 5 minutes. If the report is in the cache, it delivers it directly; otherwise, it calls the service, stores the result in the cache, and then returns it.

### Implementation Details

This example is implemented in TypeScript with Node.js and Express:

- `ReportGeneratorInterface`: Defines the contract for report generation
- `ReportGeneratorService`: Implements the actual report generation (simulated with a 5-second delay)
- `ReportGeneratorProxy`: Implements the same interface but adds caching functionality
- `CacheEntry`: Stores a report response with a timestamp for cache invalidation
- `ReportRepository`: Manages report storage and retrieval
- `ReportGeneratorController`: Handles HTTP requests for report operations

### Running the Example

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Use the API:
   - Create a report: `POST /reports`
   - Generate a report: `GET /reports/:id/generate`

### Key Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps caching logic separate from business logic.
- **Flexibility**: Allows adding functionality without modifying the original object.
- **Optimization**: Reduces redundant operations, such as regenerating reports unnecessarily.

### Conclusion

The Proxy pattern is a powerful tool for scenarios where you need to control access, optimize performance, or add functionality without altering the original object.
