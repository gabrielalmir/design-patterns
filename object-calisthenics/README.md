# Object Calisthenics

Object Calisthenics is a set of programming exercises designed to encourage better object-oriented design. These exercises aim to improve code readability, maintainability, and adherence to object-oriented principles.

## Rules of Object Calisthenics

1. **Only One Level of Indentation per Method**: Simplifies methods and encourages smaller, more focused methods.
2. **Don't Use the `else` Keyword**: Promotes early returns and reduces nested logic.
3. **Wrap All Primitives and Strings**: Encourages the use of meaningful types instead of raw data.
4. **First Class Collections**: Collections should be encapsulated in their own classes.
5. **One Dot per Line**: Avoids chaining calls and enforces proper encapsulation.
6. **Don't Abbreviate**: Improves code readability by using meaningful names.
7. **Keep All Entities Small**: Classes and methods should be concise and focused.
8. **No Classes with More Than Two Instance Variables**: Encourages better separation of concerns.
9. **No Getters/Setters/Properties**: Promotes behavior-driven design instead of exposing internal state.

## Benefits

- Encourages clean, modular, and testable code.
- Helps developers think in terms of objects and their responsibilities.
- Reduces complexity and improves code quality.

## Conclusion

Object Calisthenics is a valuable practice for developers aiming to refine their object-oriented programming skills. By adhering to these rules, you can create more robust and maintainable software.
